Figma Your Life
I made a website about an Anime character named Eren. It has 3 pages and uses bootstrap elements like a nav bar and carousel.
peer review - Raudel Alvarado
It would have been nice if You had a starting page before going into reading the story. the about me is also miss aligned throughout the whole html spcae. Some nav bars as well are not the same size and the words dont are not aligned the same. also the about me and the attack on titan logo go into the same about me page which is kind of not usefull. the carousel was nice and it matches your figma as well.
